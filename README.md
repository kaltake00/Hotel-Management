# Hotel Management Application

## Introduction

Not so long ago I was working on a website for a Hotel in my city. That's how I came up with the idea of creating an application that will facilitate hotel owners' complete management.
I took this very idea as my goal, to enable complete but quick and simple management of the hotel, hotel rooms, staff and clients. Currently, this project is not finished, but I try to make some progress every day.

Currently, you can find the following options on the project:

* authentication (login and register)
* user profile
* admin dashboard with additional tabs
* creating, deleting and editing rooms.
* Booking rooms and more...

I worked on the project alone, improving my skills, and my goal is to get a job thanks to the skills I showed on this project.

## Technologies

For this project I chose technologies and frameworks that are based on `JavaScript`. Also what I strive to be in the near future is a MERN Stack developer.

* React.js 
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MySQL

## Setup

To run this project, install it locally using `npm`

```
$ cd ../Hotel Management App
$ npm install
$ node index.js // to start backend server (Its highly recommended to start backend server before starting frontend app)
$ cd client
$ npm start

```
